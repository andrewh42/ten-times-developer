This directory contains spike code for the Z3 solver. It's not part of the shokunin submission
but you can run it using python3 like this:

    pip install z3-solver
    python z3-spike.py

The expected output is:

    [Matt = 5, Jessie = 3, Evan = 4, John = 2, Sarah = 1]
    Sarah, John, Jessie, Evan, Matt
